## Assumptions:

- All vehicles have same length.
- All vehicles have same dynamics.

## Experiments:

- Try different spatial/temporal/controller resolutions.

## Extensions:

- Add more lanes.
- Add entry/exit points.
- Add constraints on vehicle kinematics/dynamics.
- Add error/uncertainty in human driving.
- Add error/uncertainty in robot sensing.
- Add more robots (with and without knowledge of each other).
- Add different driving styles.
